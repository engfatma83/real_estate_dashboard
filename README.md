# Real Estate Overview

This project presents an **interactive Real Estate Dashboard** designed to analyze sales performance, revenue trends, property distribution, and agent productivity across multiple dimensions. 
The dashboard helps stakeholders such as real estate managers, analysts, and decision-makers monitor **financial performance, sales channels, and market distribution over time**. 
The dashboard focuses on **2024 data**, with year-based filtering to compare historical performance (2022–2024).

### Key Objectives
- Track revenue, expenses, and income
- Analyze monthly sales trends
- Identify top-performing property types
- Evaluate sales channels effectiveness
- Monitor agent performance
- Visualize geographical distribution of sales

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the exploratory phase, the following insights and patterns were examined:

#### 1 Revenue & Financial Metrics
- Total Revenue: 26M
- Total Expenses: 9M
- Total Income: 17M
- Total Properties Sold: 44

Key initial observation:

- Despite a −37.5% revenue change, income remains strong, indicating controlled expenses.

#### 2  Monthly Revenue Trends
- Revenue fluctuates across months.
- July shows the highest revenue (~6.1M).
- January & May are comparatively lower-performing months.

This indicates seasonal demand variations in the real estate market.

#### 3  Sales Channels Analysis

Revenue contribution by sales channel:
- Broker: ~37.2%
- Online: ~34.9%
- Direct: ~27.8%

Insight:

- Brokers remain the dominant channel, but online sales are closely competitive, suggesting strong digital adoption.

#### 4  Property Type Performance

- Top-performing property types:
- Condos: 7.5M
- Single Family Homes: 7.3M
- Apartments: 6.9M
- Townhouses: 3.8M

Insight:

- Condos and single-family homes generate the highest revenue, while townhouses lag behind.

#### 5 Agent Performance

The dashboard ranks agents by total properties sold.
- Top agents sold between 7–8 properties.
- Some agents have significantly lower counts, indicating uneven workload or performance.
  
#### 6 Geographical Distribution
- Strong sales concentration in North America.
- Noticeable activity in Europe and Asia.
- Lower sales presence in Africa and South America.

### Analysis & Insights
- Revenue peaks align with specific months, highlighting seasonal buying behavior.
- Brokers still lead revenue generation, but online sales are rapidly catching up.
- Property demand favors condos and single-family houses, possibly driven by urbanization and family housing needs.
- Agent performance is not evenly distributed, suggesting opportunities for sales redistribution or training.
- Global sales show regional imbalance, indicating potential growth opportunities in underperforming regions.

  ### Tools Used
  - Excel ( for data cleaning)
  - Power BI ( For Visulaization)
 
  ### Limitations
- The dataset represents a **limited time window**, focusing mainly on 2024.
- External factors such as **economic conditions, interest rates, or inflation** are not included.
- Customer demographics (age, income level) are unavailable, limiting behavioral insights.
- The dashboard reflects **historical data only** no predictive modeling is included.
- Data source assumptions may affect accuracy if inputs are incomplete or outdated.
